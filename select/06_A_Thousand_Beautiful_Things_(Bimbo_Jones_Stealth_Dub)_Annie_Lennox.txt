Every day I write the list
Of reasons why I still believe they do exist
(A thousand beautiful things)
And even though it's hard to see
The glass is full and not half empty
(A thousand beautiful things)

So light me up like the sun
To cool down with your rain
I never want to close my eyes again
Never close my eyes
Never close my eyes

I thank you for the air to breathe
The heart to beat, the eyes to see again
(A thousand beautiful things)
And all the things that's been and done
The battle's won, the good and bad in everyone
(This is mine to remember)

So here I go again
(Here I go)
Singin' by your window
(Singin')
Pickin' up the pieces of what's left to find
(Pickin' up, pickin' up)
(Pickin' up, pickin' up)

The world was meant for you and me
To figure out our destiny
Whao remember
To live, to die, to breathe, to sleep
To try to make your life complete

So light me up like the sun
To cool down with your rain
I never want to close my eyes again
Never close my eyes
Never close my eyes

That is everything I have to say
That is everything I have to say
That is everything I have to say
That is everything I have to say
