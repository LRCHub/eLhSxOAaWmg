[00:09.03] In a fire, I lie
[00:11.05] Do I fall? Do I fly?
[00:13.70] So hard to move in the flames of the night
[00:17.38] I'm watching the dust as it falls and it settles on my fate
[00:46.88] 
[00:24.84] There's no sound now in the quiet
[00:29.69] It's just me and my thoughts
[00:34.24] And they scream out, saying nothing
[00:38.79] And I'm bound, oh
[00:47.29] 
[00:43.41] My last penny, lover left me
[00:48.36] Thought I'd died and ended up in hell
[00:52.55] But the heat brings relief
[00:57.16] Beautiful things can happen anywhere
[01:15.16] 
[01:05.02] Twisted by terror
[01:06.85] All my turmoil has taught me and the tide is now turned
[01:12.83] And the situation, my liberation has followed me softly
[01:40.33] 
[01:20.52] There's no sound now in the quiet
[01:25.24] It's just me and my thoughts
[01:29.70] And they scream out, saying nothing
[01:34.60] And I'm bound, oh
[01:43.10] 
[01:39.01] My last penny, lover left me
[01:43.82] Thought I'd died and ended up in hell
[01:48.53] But the heat brings relief
[01:52.79] Beautiful things can happen anywhere
[02:10.79] 
[01:58.18] My last penny, lover left me
[02:02.47] Thought I'd died and ended up in hell
[02:07.15] But the heat brings relief
[02:11.40] Beautiful things can happen anywhere
[02:17.83] They can happen anywhere
[02:29.83] 
[02:29.04] They can happen anywhere
